Ken completed his PhD in 2013. While in the lab he was awarded Utah State University’s three most prestigious graduate fellowships. After a postdoc at the University of Indiana, serving as a co-PI on a National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodiversity grant, he joined Diné College of the Navajo Nation and was promoted to associate professor. Ken is now a senior clinical data scientist at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago. There, he focuses on predicting patient outcomes, the spread of contagious disease, and to improving quality, safety, and value within healthcare systems.
